## velocity
from initial calculate change after collision.
the difference between the inital and new velocity after collision maps to 
vibration.

## Synchrony (Over a period of time)
Does it make sense to measure instantanious synchrony?
Maybe measure synchrony over a period of interaction.

Maybe try to find whether it is in phase or anti-phase.

What is the frequency of the velocity updates?
